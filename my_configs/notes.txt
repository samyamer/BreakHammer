atk2_s.trace -> just a duplication of the 75 instructions in the atk1 trace

1.
hydra, mean, false, 512,32,0.65,mix_41 but with atk2_s.trace

No difference at all between atk1.trace and atk2_s.trace

3.
Run two attacker cores with normal breakhammer
hydra, mean, false, 512,32,0.65,mix_41 but with atk2_s.trace
